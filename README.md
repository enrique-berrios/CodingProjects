# Coding Projects

In this github repo I will document my coding process on becoming a pro in using python.

Have fun trying some of these ideas out yourself. And let me know if u found a clever solution.

## Project list:

- Manim Animations (work in progress)
  > Zeitstrahl
  > Kepplers Law
  > Harmonischer Oszillator
  > Pendulum (not started)
